## Standard List Controller

Standard List Controller - To create Visualforce pages that can display or act on a set of records.  The standard list controller provides many powerful, automatic behaviors such as querying for records of a specific object and making the records available in a collection variable, as well as filtering of and pagination through the results. Adding the standard list controller to a page is very similar to adding the standard (record) controller, but with the intent of working with many records at once, instead of one record at a time.

### Display a List of Records

Use the standard list controller and an iteration component, such as `<apex:pageBlockTable>`, to display a list of records.
